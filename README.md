# MAGE
MAGE: A Multi-Agent Engine for Automated RTL Code Generation
# Mage Project: [Your Project Name/Purpose Here]

This repository contains a project built using the [Mage AI](https://www.mage.ai/) data pipeline tool.

## Overview

(Please provide a brief description of what this Mage project does. For example, is it an ETL pipeline, a data transformation workflow, an ML model training pipeline, etc.?)

This project appears to utilize custom Python scripts:
*   `MAGEcore.py`: Likely contains the core logic, custom blocks, or foundational components for the Mage pipelines in this project.
*   `promptman.py`: Potentially a module for managing, generating, or interacting with prompts, possibly for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI-driven components within the Mage pipelines.

## Key Files

*   `MAGEcore.py`: Core functionalities and/or custom Mage block definitions.
*   `promptman.py`: Utilities or logic related to prompt management.
*   `[your_pipeline_name].yaml` (Example - add your actual pipeline YAML files here): Mage pipeline definition files.
*   Other Python files for custom data loaders, transformers, exporters, etc.

(You should list your main Mage pipeline YAML files and any other significant Python scripts here.)

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Mage AI installed (e.g., `pip install mage-ai`)
*   Any other specific Python libraries imported in `MAGEcore.py`, `promptman.py`, or your Mage blocks (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you have this `MAGE` directory.**

2.  **Install Mage AI (if not already installed globally):**
    ```bash
    pip install mage-ai
    ```

3.  **Install project-specific dependencies:**
    If you have a `requirements.txt` file for this project, install it:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If you create one
    ```
    Otherwise, manually install any libraries used in your custom scripts.

4.  **Initialize a Mage project (if this directory isn't one already):**
    If this `MAGE` directory isn't already a Mage project root (i.e., it doesn't have a `metadata.yaml` or a `mage_data` subdirectory created by Mage), you might need to initialize one:
    ```bash
    mage init your_project_name
    ```
    Then, you would typically place your `MAGEcore.py`, `promptman.py`, and create/import your pipelines into this initialized Mage project structure.
    *Alternatively, if this `MAGE` directory IS already a Mage project, this step is not needed.*

## Starting Mage

1.  Navigate to your Mage project directory (this `MAGE/` directory or the one you initialized).
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/MAGE # or your initialized Mage project directory
    ```

2.  Start the Mage development server:
    ```bash
    mage start your_project_name_slug # Replace with your project's slug/name
    ```
    Mage will typically tell you the URL to access the UI (e.g., `http://localhost:6789`).

## Usage

*   Open the Mage UI in your browser.
*   Create new pipelines or import existing ones (if defined in YAML files you add to the project).
*   You can likely import and use functions or classes from `MAGEcore.py` and `promptman.py` within your custom Python blocks in Mage pipelines.
*   Run your pipelines, monitor their progress, and manage their schedules through the Mage UI.
